# SummerPad 🌊
![0104](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24d6425d-698a-4902-aaa0-c67273bd43c9)
> **"Word processors are too loud. SummerPad is quiet."**


SummerPad is not just a notepad; it is a **Mood Engine**. It forces you to choose a "vibe" before you write, locking you into a specific font, color palette, and emotional state. 

Built for poets, hackers, screenwriters, and anyone who needs to focus.
